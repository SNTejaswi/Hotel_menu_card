# Hotel_menu_card
--This Python program simulates a simple restaurant ordering system where customers can choose items from a menu and confirm their order. The system provides:--
# A menu display with item names and prices.
#A user-friendly order-taking process.
# A "yes/no" option to continue or stop ordering.
#A limit of 5 items, but customers can exit earlier.
# Simple & User-Friendly – No complicated loops, just a yes/no choice.
# Handles Errors – If an item isn’t available, it notifies the user.
# Limits Orders – Prevents excessive input by allowing a max of 5 items.
# Early Exit Option – Customers can stop ordering anytime by saying "no".
